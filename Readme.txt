Accordion Category Display is a WordPress plugin to elegantly display posts within categories in an accordion-style layout, resembling a file directory.

== Description ==

Accordion Category Display plugin allows you to showcase your posts or custom post types within categories, in an accordion-style layout that mimics a file directory structure. It's designed to work seamlessly with ACF Extended (ACFE) to create a 'document' post type and 'document categories' taxonomy, but it can be adapted for regular posts as well.

Features:
- Display categories and posts in an accordion layout.
- Works with ACF Extended for creating a custom 'document' post type and taxonomy.
- Easy to adapt for use with standard WordPress posts.
- Fully responsive and accessible.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `accordion-category-display` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Use the shortcode `[document_category_list]` in your posts or pages to display the accordion.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use this plugin with standard WordPress posts? =

Yes. While this plugin is configured for use with custom post types created by ACF Extended, it can be adapted for regular posts. To do this, edit the `functions.php` file in the `includes` directory and modify the `post_type` and `taxonomy` parameters to suit standard posts and categories.
